"""DeepTrack2 core package.

This package provides the core classes and functionality required for managing, 
processing, and evaluating data within the DeepTrack framework. It is designed 
to support building flexible pipelines for scientific data analysis and machine 
learning applications.

This package is the core component of the DeepTrack2 framework. It enables 
users to:
- Construct flexible and efficient computational pipelines.
- Manage data and dependencies in a hierarchical structure.
- Perform lazy evaluations for performance optimization.

Main Features
-------------
Data Management:
- `DeepTrackDataObject` and `DeepTrackDataDict` provide tools to store, 
  validate, and manage data with dependency tracking.
- Enables nested structures and flexible indexing for complex data 
  hierarchies.

Computational Graphs:
- `DeepTrackNode` forms the backbone of computation pipelines, representing 
  nodes in a computation graph.
- Nodes support lazy evaluation, dependency tracking, and caching to 
  optimize performance.
- Implements mathematical operators for easy composition of computational 
  graphs.

Citations:
- Supports citing the relevant publication (`Midtvedt et al., 2021`) to 
  ensure proper attribution.

Utilities:
- Includes helper functions like `_equivalent` and 
  `_create_node_with_operator` to streamline graph operations.

Package Structure
-----------------
Data Containers:
- `DeepTrackDataObject`: A basic container for data with validation status.
- `DeepTrackDataDict`: Stores multiple data objects indexed by unique access 
                       IDs, enabling nested data storage.

Computation Nodes:
- `DeepTrackNode`: Represents a node in a computation graph, capable of lazy 
                   evaluation, caching, and dependency management.

Citation Management:
- Provides support for including citations in pipelines for academic and 
  scientific use.

Example
-------
Create a DeepTrackNode with an action:

>>> node = DeepTrackNode(lambda x: x**2)
>>> node.store(5)

Retrieve the stored value:

>>> print(node.current_value())  # Output: 25

    data since it was last updated.

    -------
    store(data : Any)

class DeepTrackDataDict:
    """Stores multiple data objects indexed by a tuple of integers (access ID).

    This class allows a single object to store multiple `DeepTrackDataObject` 
    instances concurrently, each associated with a unique tuple of integers 
    (the access ID). This is particularly useful for handling sequences of data 
    or nested structures, as required by features like `Repeat`.

    The default access ID is an empty tuple `()`. Once an entry is created, all 
    IDs must match the established key length. If an ID longer than the 
    stored length is requested, the request is trimmed. If an ID shorter than 
    what is stored is requested, a dictionary slice containing all matching 
    entries is returned. This mechanism supports flexible indexing of nested 
    data and ensures that dependencies at various nesting depths can be 
    correctly handled.

    Example
    -------
    Consider the following structure, where `Repeat` is a feature that creates
    multiple instances of another feature:

    >>> F = Repeat(Repeat(DummyFeature(prop=np.random.rand), 2), 2)

    Here, `F` contains 2 * 2 = 4 instances of the feature `prop`. 
    These can be accessed using the IDs:
    (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).

    In this nested structure:
    - (0, 0) refers to the first repeat of the outer feature and the first 
        repeat of the inner feature.
    - (0, 1) refers to the first repeat of the outer feature and the second 
        repeat of the inner feature.
    And so forth, resolving nested structures via tuples of indices.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    keylength : int or None
        The length of the IDs currently stored. Set when the first entry is 
        created. If `None`, no entries have been created yet, and any ID length 
        is valid.
    dict : Dict[Tuple[int, ...], DeepTrackDataObject]
        A dictionary mapping tuples of integers (IDs) to `DeepTrackDataObject` 
        instances.

    Methods
    -------
    invalidate()
        Marks all stored data objects as invalid.
    validate()
        Marks all stored data objects as valid.
    valid_index(_ID : Tuple[int, ...]) -> bool
        Checks if the given ID is valid for the current configuration.
    create_index(_ID : Tuple[int, ...] = ())
        Creates an entry for the given ID if it does not exist.
    __getitem__(_ID : tuple) -> Union[
            DeepTrackDataObject, 
            Dict[Tuple[int, ...], DeepTrackDataObject]
        ]
        Retrieves data associated with the ID. Can return a 
        `DeepTrackDataObject` or a dict of matching entries if `_ID` is shorter 
        than `keylength`.

_DESCRIPTION = """
We provide two image stacks where each contains 20 sections from serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) 
of the Drosophila melanogaster third instar larva ventral nerve cord. 
Both stacks measure approx. 4.7 x 4.7 x 1 microns with a resolution of 4.6 x 4.6 nm/pixel and section 
thickness of 45-50 nm.

In addition to the raw image data, 
we provide for the first stack a dense labeling of neuron membranes (including orientation and junction),
mitochondria, synapses and glia/extracellular space. 
The first stack serves as a training dataset, and a second stack of the same dimension can be used as a test dataset.

labels: Series of merged labels including oriented membranes, membrane junctions,
mitochondria and synapses. The pixels are labeled as follows:
    0   -> membrane | (0째)
    32  -> membrane / (45째)
    64  -> membrane - (90째)
    96  -> membrane \ (135째)
    128 -> membrane "junction"
    159 -> glia/extracellular
    191 -> mitochondria
    223 -> synapse
    255 -> intracellular

# MAGIK

MAGIK is a geometric deep learning approach for the analysis of dynamical properties from time-lapse microscopy.
Here we provide the code as well as instructions to train models and to analyze experimental data.

# Getting started

## Installation from PyPi

MAGIK requires at least python 3.6.

To install MAGIK you must install the [Deeptrack](https://github.com/softmatterlab/DeepTrack-2.0) framework. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

    pip install deeptrack
  

## Software requirements
### OS Requirements
MAGIK has been tested on the following systems:
+ macOS: Monterey (12.2.1)
+ Windows: 10 (64-bit)


### Python Dependencies
```
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
Sphinx==2.2.0
pydata-sphinx-theme
numpydoc
scikit-image
tensorflow-probability
pydeepimagej
pint
pandas

```
If you have a very recent version of python, you may need to install numpy _before_ DeepTrack. This is a known issue with scikit-image.


## It's a kind of MAGIK...

To see MAGIK in action, we provide an [example](//github.com/softmatterlab/DeepTrack-2.0/blob/develop/examples/MAGIK/) based on live-cell migration experiments. Data courtesy of Sergi Masó Orriols, [the QuBI lab](https://mon.uvic.cat/qubilab/).

"""Radial center calculation function

This module provides a function to calculate the center location
of a given intensity distribution.

Key Features
------------

- **Gradient-based analysis with least-squares method.**

  Uses intensity gradients to determine the
  radial symmetry of 2D intensity distributions.
  

- **Flexible output**

  Allows inversion of the axis based on user preference.


Module Structure
----------------
Functions:

- `radialcenter`: Calculates the center of a 2D intensity distribution.

Example
-------
Calculate center of an image containing randomly generated Gaussian blur.

>>> from deeptrack.extras import radialcenter as rc

>>> linspace = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
>>> gaussian = np.exp(-0.5 * (
...            linspace[:, None] ** 2 + linspace[None, :] ** 2)
...        )
>>> intensity_map = np.random.normal(0, 0.005, (100, 100))
>>> x, y = rc.radialcenter(gaussian_blur)
>>> print(f"Center of distribution = {x}, {y}")

  """Calculates the center of a 2D intensity distribution.

  Considers lines passing through each half-pixel point with slope
  parallel to the gradient of the intensity at that point. Considers the
  distance of closest approach between these lines and the coordinate
  origin, and determines (analytically) the origin that minimizes the
  weighted sum of these distances-squared.

  Parameters
  ----------
  I : np.ndarray
    2D intensity distribution (i.e. a grayscale image)
    Size need not be an odd number of pixels along each dimension

  Returns
  -------
  float, float
      Coordinate pair x, y of the center of radial symmetry, 
      px, from px #1 = left/topmost pixel.
      So a shape centered in the middle of a 2*N+1 x 2*N+1
      square (e.g. from make2Dgaussian.m with x0=y0=0) will return
      a center value at x0=y0=N+1.

      Note that y increases with increasing row number (i.e. "downward")

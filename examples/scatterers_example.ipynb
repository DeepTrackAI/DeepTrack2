    "## What is a scatterer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterers are implementations of the abstract class `Feature` that represent scattering objects (see also [features_example](features_example.ipynb)). When calculating the scattered field, they are discretized into voxels.\n",
    "\n",
    "All physcial properties of scatterers are given in SI units, unless otherwise stated. In particular, the position of a scatterer is measured from the top left corner of the image and can either be given in meters (default) or pixels by setting the property `position_unit` to `\"meter\"` or `\"pixel\"`. The z-position of the particle can either be set as the the third element of the property `position`, or as the property `z`. The calculation of a scatterer is automatically upsampled using the `upsample` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "All scatterers need a reference to the optical system through which they are viewed in order to calculate scale factors. This is achieved by calling an optical device from the `optics` module (see also [optics_example](optics_example.ipynb)) with the scatterer. "

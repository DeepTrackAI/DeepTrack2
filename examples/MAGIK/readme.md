# MAGIK

MAGIK is a geometric deep learning approach for the analysis of dynamical properties from time-lapse microscopy.
Here we provide the code as well as instructions to train models and to analyze experimental data.

# Getting started

## Installation from PyPi

MAGIK requires at least python 3.6.

To use MAGIK you must install the [Deeplay](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/deeplay) package. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

    pip install deeplay

This will also install the required dependencies.

## Software requirements

### OS Requirements

MAGIK has been tested on the following systems:

- macOS: Monterey (12.2.1)
- Windows: 10 (64-bit)

## It's a kind of MAGIK...

To see MAGIK in action, we provide an [example](//github.com/softmatterlab/DeepTrack-2.0/blob/develop/examples/MAGIK/Tracking_hela_cells.ipynb) of tracking and segmenting migrating cells on a glass slide. Data courtesy of [Gert van Cappellen](https://pure.eur.nl/en/persons/gert-van-cappellen).
